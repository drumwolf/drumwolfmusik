Shoegaze first emerged in the very early ’90s, defined by its swirling walls of distorted guitars, hushed vocals,
and an inward-facing stage presence (the genre was named because the joke was that the musicians were staring down
at their shoes).  Its commercial impact was limited at best, as it was overshadowed by grunge in the US and 
Britpop in the UK -- but it established a fiercely loyal cult following which would keep its textures and aesthetics alive
through the late ’90s and 2000s.

In the decades since that first wave, a new generation of bands has reinterpreted the sound, 
blending classic influences with elements of dream pop, post-rock, electronic music, and even metal.
Here are a few shoegazers you should be aware of that have kept the flame burning since the first wave of the '90s.

### Mo Dotti

Comprised of Gina Negrini (vocals/guitar), Guy Valdez (guitar), bassist Greg Shilto (bass), Andrew Mackelvie (drums),
this Los Angeles quartet put out their first EP *Blurring* in 2020 and their first full-length album *Opaque* in 2024,
both self-released.
I've read comparisons online to the Cocteau Twins, Slowdive and Lush, but personally I would say more along the lines 
of *Isn't Anything*-era My Bloody Valentine.

### LSD and the Search for God

This band is hardly new at this point.  In fact, they've been around since 2005 -- although they've never been
the most prolific band during that time, having only released two EP's to date (their self-titled debut EP from 2007,
and *Heaven Is a Place* from 2016).  Yet despite such a small 
discography, they have a sizable cult following and have always kept busy playing live and touring.
The two constant members
of this band are vocalist/guitarist Andy Liszt and guitarist Chris Fifield, and singer Sophia Campbell was
also a co-founder and core member for the longest time.

### Sciflyer

Formed in Alameda, California in 2001, these guys were among the first wave of neo-shoegaze bands.  Their name comes
from a song on Swervedriver's *Raise* album, and appropriately enough, they have the same blend of dreamy shoegaze
and driving hard rock as the Swervies.  The one constant of this band has been singer/guitarist Steve Kennedy.

***Sunny Sundae Smile*** (Lazy Records, 1987)

Released as both a two-song 7" and a four-song 12" in February 1987, this was the final release to
feature David Conway.  It reached No. 6 on the UK Independent Singles Chart and secured the band
an opening spot for the Soup Dragons on their tour, but only a month later Conway would leave the band.
That was the end for him not only with MBV but with music in general, as he would transition to becoming
a writer and has since carved out a notable career in his own right.

**Lineup:**  David Conway (vocals), Kevin Shields (guitar), Debbie Googe (bass), Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums).

### The Shields/Butcher Era Begins: 1987

When David Conway left MBV, the remaining members found themselves without a frontman and 
placed an ad seeking a new singer.  They mentioned that they liked The Smiths, a move that 
they would regret as it resulted in a painful audition process that brought every
Morrissey wanna-be out of the woodwork.  Kevin Shields would later say about that experience,
"You should've seen some of the fruitballs we got!"

The particular individual that the band would settle on was Bilinda Butcher, who had learned
about the band after her partner met Ó Cíosóig on a ferry from the Netherlands. 
On paper, she was hardly an obvious choice to replace David Conway --
she had relatively little prior musical experience, her dreamy breathy vocals were nothing like Conway's
gothic croon, and her audition consisted of her singing Dolly Parton's ["The Bargain Store."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1TXnTjbf4A)
Nevertheless, something about her clicked with the band.

However, Butcher did not become a direct one-to-one replacement for Conway. 
Instead, she and Shields would share both singing and guitar duties. 
This was the start of My Bloody Valentine's classic lineup, and it marked 
a decisive break from the band’s earlier identity and accelerated the shift toward a new sound and internal dynamic.

**"Strawberry Wine"** (12" single, Lazy Records, 1987)

Bilinda Butcher made her recording debut on this non-album single, which came out in November 1987.
Building on the stylistic foundation laid by *The New Record* and *Sunny Sundae Smile*,
it continues to explore melodic textures, jangly guitars, and the dual-vocal approach that would define the band’s later sound.

**Lineup:** Kevin Shields / Bilinda Butcher (guitar, vocals), Debbie Googe (bass), Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums).

***Ecstasy*** (Lazy Records, 1987)

Dropping just weeks after "Strawberry Wine," *Ecstasy* would be MBV's last release before signing to Creation Records.
It develops the noise-pop and melodic direction MBV had begun exploring with Shields and Butcher,
consolidating the dual-vocal dynamic and setting the stage for the band’s first canonical releases.

**Lineup:** Kevin Shields / Bilinda Butcher (guitar, vocals), Debbie Googe (bass), Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums).

*Strawberry Wine* and *Ecstasy* would later be compiled into a single album called *Ecstasy and Wine*,
released on Lazy Records in February 1989.

Following these releases, Creation Records founder Alan McGee invited My Bloody Valentine to sign with his label,
and this is where MBV's story moves into familiar territory that has already been explored by far more
qualified people than myself.  The purpose of this article is to focus on the early transitional years 
before their signature shoegaze sound crystallized.
