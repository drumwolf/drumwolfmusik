Shoegaze first emerged in the very early ’90s, defined by its swirling walls of distorted guitars, hushed vocals,
and an inward-facing stage presence (the genre was named because the joke was that the musicians were staring down
at their shoes).  Its commercial impact was limited at best, as it was overshadowed by grunge in the US and 
Britpop in the UK -- but it established a fiercely loyal cult following which has kept its textures and aesthetics alive
since then.  In the decades since that first wave, a new generation of bands has reinterpreted the sound, 
blending classic influences with elements of dream pop, post-rock, electronic music, and even metal.

This will be the first in a multipart series about shoegaze bands that have been keeping the genre alive and kicking
in the years since *Loveless* first dropped.  For this article, let's start with the first wave of "nu-gaze," which
appeared just right before and after Y2K.

### Southpacific

The line between post-rock, shoegaze and space-rock is pretty thin, and this Ottawa-based trio
has been labeled with all three.  Consisting of Joachim Toelke, Graeme Fleming, and Phil Stewart-Bowes,
they came and went like a flash in the late '90s, leaving behind only one EP and one full-length album in their wake --
although they did finally reunite in 2020 and have since resumed performing and recording again.

### Sciflyer

Formed in Alameda, California in 2001, this  were among the first wave of neo-shoegaze bands.  Their name comes
from a song on Swervedriver's *Raise* album, and appropriately enough, they have the same blend of dreamy shoegaze
and driving hard rock as the Swervies.  The one constant of this band has been singer/guitarist Steve Kennedy.

### LSD and the Search for God

This band formed in the Bay Area in 2005, and they're still together to this day -- but they've never been
the most prolific band, having only released two EP's to date (their self-titled debut EP from 2007,
and *Heaven Is a Place* from 2016).  Yet despite such a small 
discography, they have a sizable cult following.
The two constant members
of this band are vocalist/guitarist Andy Liszt and guitarist Chris Fifield, and singer Sophia Campbell was
also a co-founder and core member for the longest time.

### Voyager One

This Seattle band was on the harder side of the shoegaze umbrella, as they were often compared to Ride, 
Swervedriver and Catherine Wheel.

### She's Green

This Minneapolis band is definitely one of the newer ones, as they only started performing in 2022 (although vocalist
Zofia Smith and guitarist Liam Armstrong had already started collaborating while roommates during the COVID-19 pandemic).

### Mo Dotti

Comprised of Gina Negrini (vocals/guitar), Guy Valdez (guitar), bassist Greg Shilto (bass), Andrew Mackelvie (drums),
this Los Angeles quartet put out their first EP *Blurring* in 2020 and their first full-length album *Opaque* in 2024,
both self-released.
I've read comparisons online to the Cocteau Twins, Slowdive and Lush, but personally I would say more along the lines 
of *Isn't Anything*-era My Bloody Valentine.

### Bysts

This isn't your mom and dad's shoegaze, and it's arguably not pure straight shoegaze at all as it combines elements of
noise rock, post-punk, psychedelic rock and electronic music -- there are distinct influences from the likes of proto-shoegaze
post-punk bands like Love and Rockets and *Psychocandy*-era Jesus and Mary Chain.
