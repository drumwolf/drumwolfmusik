Grunge may be remembered as one of the defining musical genres of the 1990's, but most people are only familiar with the very surface
of that scene.  At the time, it was just part of a much wider and more vaguely defined underground rock music scene that was national
and even global, descended from the punk and hardcore scenes but going beyond it.  And when Nirvana's *Nevermind* kicked the doors open
for grunge/punk-adjacent underground bands, the major labels went on a feeding frenzy upon the underground scene.

However, in the long run, the majority of the bands that built the wider scene actually didn't reap the benefits.
The major labels cherry-picked the marketable acts and left the rest to rot.
Some were from Seattle but predated the hype, some were thousands of miles away building parallel scenes,
and some were just too raw for MTV.

What's often forgotten is that grunge wasn't just Seattle -- it was simply the reductionist label given to a much
broader, more vaguely defined, and more global underground music movement. Here are eight bands that prove it.

### Skin Yard

Active from 1985 to 1992, Skin Yard never broke through to mainstream audiences, and even today they're overlooked in grunge discussions.
Yet they have a legitimate claim to being the first grunge band. More importantly, their members built the Seattle scene that would later explode:
bassist Daniel House owned the influential C/Z Records, guitarist Jack Endino engineered the raw grunge sound 
(producing Nirvana's *Bleach*, Soundgarden's *Screaming Life*, and early Mudhoney),
original drummer Matt Cameron went on to Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, and later drummer Barrett Martin played with Screaming Trees.
Skin Yard weren't just part of the scene -- they *were* the scene.

### Tad

This band formed in 1988 right as the Seattle scene was exploding,
and they got serious buzz in the underground alongside Mudhoney and Nirvana. And with good reason:
they were arguably the heaviest and noisiest of the early Sub Pop bands,
combining old-school heavy metal with then-newer noise rock -- imagine Black Sabbath and Big Black being tossed into a blender.
Unfortunately, for that very same reason, they were overlooked when grunge went mainstream. 
By the time they signed to Giant Records in 1993, the moment had passed, and a publicity controversy
(a poster featuring Bill Clinton smoking weed) got them dropped almost immediately.
But they remain one of the most potent bands to come out of the original grunge scene.
