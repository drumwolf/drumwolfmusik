# The Rise of Post-Rock in Chicago

Chicago has long been a breeding ground for experimental music. From the blues to house music, the city has consistently pushed musical boundaries. In the 1990s, a new sound emerged that would come to define instrumental rock for decades to come.

## The Pioneers

Bands like Tortoise and The Sea and Cake pushed boundaries by blending jazz, krautrock, and indie rock into something entirely new. Their emphasis on texture over traditional song structure opened up new possibilities for what rock music could be.

### Tortoise's Influence

Tortoise's 1996 album "Millions Now Living Will Never Die" remains a watershed moment. The 21-minute opening track "Djed" exemplified the band's patient, exploratory approach to composition.

## The Scene Today

The Chicago post-rock scene continues to thrive, with new bands building on the foundation laid by these pioneers while finding their own voice.
