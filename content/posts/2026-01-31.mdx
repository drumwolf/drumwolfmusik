As I discussed in my last post, when alternative rock found mainstream success in the early '90s,
it didn't translate into rock stardom for the vast majority of bands in the underground music scene at the time.
However, while the bands mentioned in that last post deserved better than they got, at least they retained some
level of recognition and have been able to maintain steady cult followings to this day.

Here, we're going to dig deeper into the cracks. Most of the bands in this article don't get sufficient
recognition even among grunge/punk/alt-rock historians and music geeks. If Part 1's bands were overlooked,
these six are practically invisible -- but they shaped the sound of '90s alternative rock just as much.

### Bullet LaVolta

This Boston quintet wasn't grunge, but a distinctive combination of punk rock, hard rock and post-hardcore influenced by the likes of Fugazi, Hüsker Dü and Naked Raygun.
Four of their five original members were college disk jockeys, and they got their start playing college shows in Boston. Soon afterwards, they added guitarist Ken Chambers,
who was also leading his own equally fantastic alternative rock band Moving Targets. Their 1988 self-titled EP and 1989 full-length album *The Gift* (combined into one CD)
are some of the most potent contributions to the alternative rock space in the years just before grunge broke.

Bullet LaVolta actually did get signed to a major label (RCA Records) in 1990, and released their major-label debut *Swandive* on September 24, 1991 --
the same day as *Nevermind.* The timing should have been perfect. Instead, *Nevermind* sucked all the oxygen out of the room, and *Swandive* --
was buried in the avalanche. The band broke up in 1992, victims of the very movement they'd helped build.
