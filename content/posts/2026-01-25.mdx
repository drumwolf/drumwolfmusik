Scotland.  Land of bagpipes, kilts, haggis, whiskey, the Loch Ness Monster, and some of the most incomprehensible accents in the entire Anglosphere.
Some of the more hip among y’all will also think of Irvine Welsh’s novels, most notably Trainspotting.
And if you’re talking about Scottish music, most basic normies will think of Celtic folk tunes or bands like the Proclaimers.
A few might also mention that several key members of AC/DC were born there before emigrating to Australia.

However, it’s a pretty safe bet that if you mention Scotland to most people, they likely won’t think of bands like the Jesus and Mary Chain.
Or Teenage Fanclub.  Or Belle and Sebastian.  Or Shop Assistants.  Or Orange Juice.  Or Cocteau Twins.  Or the Delgados.
Or... never mind, I could go on and on, and you already get the point.

In truth, Scotland punches far above its weight in producing excellent post-punk, alternative and indie rock bands, and it has done so from the very start.
Despite (or maybe because of) the fact that it’s as far away from London as anywhere in the UK, countless bands have come from cities and towns all over Scotland,
creating some of the most innovative and influential music of the past four decades.

Some of them are much more well-known than others, but all of them deserve a mention here.
