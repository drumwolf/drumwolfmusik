Scotland.  Land of bagpipes, kilts, haggis, whiskey, the Loch Ness Monster, and some of the most incomprehensible accents in the entire Anglosphere.
Some of the more hip among y’all will also think of Irvine Welsh’s novels, most notably *Trainspotting.*
And if you’re talking about Scottish music, most basic normies will think of Celtic folk tunes or bands like the Proclaimers.
A few might also mention that several key members of AC/DC were born there before emigrating to Australia.

However, it’s a pretty safe bet that if you mention Scotland to most people, they likely won’t think of bands like the Jesus and Mary Chain.
Or Teenage Fanclub.  Or Belle and Sebastian.  Or Shop Assistants.  Or Orange Juice.  Or Cocteau Twins.  Or the Delgados.
Or... never mind, I could go on and on, and you already get the point.

In truth, Scotland punches far above its weight in producing excellent post-punk, alternative and indie rock bands, and it has done so from the very start.
Despite (or maybe because of) the fact that it’s as far away from London as anywhere in the UK, countless bands have come from cities and towns all over Scotland,
creating some of the most innovative and influential music of the past four decades.

Some of them are much more well-known than others, but all of them deserve a mention here.

### Orange Juice

These guys may or may not have a claim to being Scotland's first indie band, but "indie pop/rock" wasn't codified as a genre or a concept when they
first formed in 1976.  Led by Edwyn Collins (who would later go on to a notable solo career), they took inspiration from then-contemporary
punk bands like the Buzzcocks and Subway Sect, as well as '60s bands like the Byrds and the Velvet Underground.  They released their music on
the independent label Postcard Records, which was co-founded by Collins and adopted the motto "The Sound of Young Scotland."  

**"Rip It Up"** (from *Rip It Up*, Polydor, 1983)

### APB

This power trio might be the most obscure out of all the bands on this list, and undeservedly so.  To be fair, they're also somewhat of an outlier
compared to most of the bands here.  While most of the bands here are more on the lo-fi/twee/jangly side, APB were a post-punk band which combined funk, punk
and new wave, and they came from a small rural town called Ellon which is a three-hour drive from either Glasgow or Edinburgh.  Oddly enough, they
somehow found their way to New York's dance clubs and got a cult following in the Tri-State Area, getting airplay on Long Island's WLIR and 
playing clubs in Manhattan and Long Island.  And they would be very influential to later bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Franz Ferdinand and the Rapture.
