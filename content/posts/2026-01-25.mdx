Scotland.  Land of bagpipes, kilts, haggis, whiskey, the Loch Ness Monster, and some of the most incomprehensible accents in the entire Anglosphere.
Some of the more hip among y’all will also think of Irvine Welsh’s novels, most notably *Trainspotting.*
And if you’re talking about Scottish music, most basic normies will think of Celtic folk tunes or bands like the Proclaimers.
A few might even remember that several key members of AC/DC were born there before heading off to Australia.

But if you mention Scotland to most listeners, they likely won’t think of bands like The Jesus and Mary Chain.
Or Teenage Fanclub.  Or Belle and Sebastian.  Or Shop Assistants.  Or Orange Juice.  Or Cocteau Twins.  Or the Delgados.
Or... never mind.  You get the idea.

In truth, Scotland punches wildly above its weight when it comes to post-punk, indie rock, and especially indie pop --
and it’s been doing so from the very beginning.
Despite (or maybe because of) the fact that it’s as far away from London as anywhere in the UK,
bands from cities and small towns across Scotland have produced some of the most inventive and influential music of the past four decades.

Some of them are much more well-known than others, but all of them deserve a mention here.

### Orange Juice

These guys may or may not have a claim to being Scotland's first indie band, but "indie pop/rock" wasn't codified as a genre or a concept when they
first formed in 1976 in the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden.  Led by Edwyn Collins (who would later go on to a notable solo career), they took inspiration from then-contemporary
punk bands like the Buzzcocks and Subway Sect, as well as '60s bands like the Byrds and the Velvet Underground.  They released their music on
the independent label Postcard Records, which was co-founded by Collins and adopted the motto "The Sound of Young Scotland."

### Cocteau Twins

While they may be superficially more "dream pop" than "indie pop" on the surface, Cocteau Twins have nevertheless been just as influential to indie pop as anyone else.
Formed in Grangemouth in 1979 and later based in Glasgow, Cocteau Twins created a sound that was dreamy, abstract, and almost completely untethered from conventional rock structures. Elizabeth Fraser’s vocals were famously less about lyrics and more about texture and emotion, floating over Robin Guthrie’s shimmering, effects-heavy guitar work.

They were closely associated with the 4AD label and became one of the defining bands of the ’80s dream pop and ethereal wave scenes,
influencing everyone from My Bloody Valentine to Beach House. Even if they don’t fit neatly into the “jangly indie” box,
modern indie pop would look very different without them.

### APB

This power trio might be the most obscure out of all the bands on this list, and to be fair, they're also somewhat of an outlier here.  While most of the bands here are more on the lo-fi/twee/jangly side, APB were a post-punk band which combined funk, punk
and new wave, and they came from a small rural town called Ellon which is a three-hour drive from either Glasgow or Edinburgh.  Oddly enough, they
somehow found their way to New York's dance clubs and got a cult following in the Tri-State Area, getting airplay on Long Island's WLIR and 
playing clubs in Manhattan and Long Island.  And they would be very influential to later bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Franz Ferdinand and the Rapture.

___

### The Jesus and Mary Chain

I feel like it's almost cheating to put these guys here, kind of like putting Nirvana on a list of "90s grunge bands to check out."
But it's impossible to understate how much influence these guys had, not just on Scottish indie rock but on the entire wider alternative/indie music genre as a whole,
and countless other writers have already done a better job at explaining it than I could.  

That said, they were one of the first bands to come up with the idea of
combining noisy rock and experimental music with classic pop like the Beach Boys and '60s girl groups.  Not bad for a pair of brothers who wanted to alleviate their
boredom while growing up in the town of East Kilbride, a city just outside Glasgow which was a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom" target="_new">"new town"</a>
(i.e. a postwar planned community) when they were growing up.

___

### The Pastels

This band's "shambling" DIY twee pop has made them a cult favorite and one of the most influential bands in the indie pop genre,
but they've remained far more influential than popular.  Imagine
a British version of Beat Happening except with a much fuller lineup, and you'll get the idea.  Formed in 1981 in Glasgow, 
this band was originally part of the same scene as Orange Juice, as one of its founding members Brian Taylor was a friend of Postcard Records
founder Alan Horne, but for most of their existence they've been primarily led by singer/guitarist Stephen Pastel (aka McRobbie).
