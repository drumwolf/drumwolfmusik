When most people think of Scotland, they usually think of bagpipes, kilts, whisky, the Loch Ness Monster, stunning landscapes like the Highlands with their lochs and castles, 
tartan, haggis, and rich Celtic culture.  And some of the more hip of you will think of Irvine Welsh's novels including *Trainspotting*, soccer hooligans, and ravers.
If you think of Scottish music, you'll think of traditional Celtic folk tunes with bagpipes and folk punk and Celtic punk bands.  Oh, and multiple key members of AC/DC were born there too.

Less likely to be on your mind, I bet, are bands like the Jesus and Mary Chain.  Or the Cocteau Twins.  Or the Vaselines.  Or Orange Juice.  Or The Pastels.
