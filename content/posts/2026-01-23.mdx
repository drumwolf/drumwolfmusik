Think you know '90s alternative rock?  Nirvana?  Smashing Pumpkins?  Green Day?  No, not that mainstream Top 40 crap.  No, you *know* your bands.  Mudhoney, My Bloody Valentine, Pavement.  *Real* underground stuff, right?

Wrong!  There are countless bands that were every bit as deserving of attention as any of the ones I've named.  And some of them even *did* get attention at the time, but I don't see their names turn up so much these days. 
Either way, you should know about these bands and maybe with any luck I might be able to shine a light on them.

- ### Seam

Led by guitarist and singer Sooyoung Park, they were originally formed in Chapel Hill and their first album featured Superchunk's Mac McCaughan on drums.  Then they moved to Chicago, and they released several more albums of moody 
slowcore/post-hardcore/emo over the course of the '90s.

- ### Swirlies

These guys formed in Boston in 1990 and were one of America's earliest bands to wander into the shoegaze waters.

---

- ### Tsunami

In the early '90s, leaders Jenny Toomey and Kristin Thomson had a whole little indie rock empire going!  Not only was their band one of the best that underground American indie rock had to offer, but they
also ran an indie label called Simple Machines.

- ### Lungfish

Tortoise's 1996 album "Millions Now Living Will Never Die" remains a watershed moment. The 21-minute opening track "Djed" exemplified the band's patient, exploratory approach to composition.
