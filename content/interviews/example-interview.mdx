# Interview: Mogwai on Their Latest Album

We caught up with Mogwai's Stuart Braithwaite to discuss the band's approach to creating their latest record, their evolution over the years, and what keeps them motivated after more than two decades of making music.

## On the Creative Process

**drumwolfmusik:** Thanks for taking the time to chat with us. Your latest album shows a different side of Mogwai. What inspired this direction?

**Stuart Braithwaite:** We've always tried to avoid repeating ourselves. Each album is a snapshot of where we are at that moment, and this time we wanted to explore more electronic textures while keeping the intensity that people expect from us.

## Looking Back, Moving Forward

**drumwolfmusik:** After so many years, what keeps you inspired?

**Stuart Braithwaite:** Honestly, we still get excited about making noise together. The chemistry in the band is still there, and we're always discovering new sounds and approaches that keep it fresh for us.
